        **Unversioned, and outside `/api`.** `docs/api/README.md` section 2 puts
        the wire surface under `v1` and leaves mechanics unversioned; a
        healthcheck is mechanics. A compose `healthcheck` or a load balancer
        pointed at `/api/v1/health` would break the day v2 lands, which is the
        opposite of what the probe is for.

        **Deliberately does not check Groq.** `ai_enabled`, the token bucket and
        the queue depth belong to `GET /api/v1/system/ai-status`. If a provider
        outage made this endpoint fail, `restart: unless-stopped` would restart a
        perfectly healthy API in a loop -- and the REST layer genuinely does
        work without a model, which is the point of `_require_enabled`.

        Returns 503 rather than raising when the database is unreachable: a
        probe needs a status code, and a traceback through the exception
        handler is a 500 that says less.
