"""The connectivity check, and the only prompt in Phase 0.

Not a product prompt. It exists so that task 0.3's acceptance test -- "a smoke
test returns a parsed object and a populated usage record" -- can run against
the real Groq endpoint without any pipeline existing, and so that the registry
has something to prove itself against.

Kept afterwards: it is the cheapest possible answer to "is the key valid, is
the model id right, and does constrained decoding actually work on this
account", which is worth having when a later failure is ambiguous.
