"""The model half of attendee name resolution -- task 2.4.

Called only on what ``services/roster.py`` could not settle: a similarity score
in the band between "clearly nobody we know" and "clearly this person". On the
fixture corpus that is nothing at all, which is the intended shape -- the model
is the exception path, not the mechanism.

The deterministic half stays in ``services/roster.py`` on purpose. Resolution
has to work with the provider turned off, and ``no_economic_buyer`` cannot
depend on a model being reachable.
