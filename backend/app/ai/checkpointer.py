"""LangGraph's conversation memory, in Postgres.

Replaces the hand-built history in ``chat.py``. The agent used to be stateless
per turn: every turn re-read ``chat_messages`` and rebuilt a list of
``HumanMessage``/``AIMessage``. That worked, but it could only replay the
*prose* -- the tool calls and tool results of earlier turns were dropped, so a
tool-using agent could see that it had answered and not what it had looked up.
A checkpointer stores the whole message graph, tool traffic included.

**``chat_messages`` is still authoritative and still written.** This is a
second store, deliberately, and the division is:

    chat_messages   the product's record -- what `GET /chat/sessions/{id}/
                    messages` serves, what `claim_evidence.claim_id` points at
                    for `claim_type='chat_message'`, and what 11.6's reaper
                    finalizes. Durable, migrated, ours.
    checkpoints     the agent's working memory -- the message graph LangGraph
                    needs to resume a thread. Disposable: delete it and the
                    conversation is still intact in chat_messages, the agent
                    just forgets the tool traffic.

That asymmetry is the whole reason this is safe to add. ``docs/schema/
README.md`` warns that two copies of the same thing can disagree, which is why
``documents.raw_text`` was dropped in 0008 -- but here only one copy is load
bearing. If they ever disagree, ``chat_messages`` wins by definition.

**The tables are not Alembic's.** ``AsyncPostgresSaver.setup()`` creates and
migrates ``checkpoints``, ``checkpoint_writes``, ``checkpoint_blobs`` and
``checkpoint_migrations`` itself, so they are outside the migration chain and
will not appear in an autogenerate diff. ``models/__init__.py``'s registry test
only walks ``Base.metadata``, so it is unaffected. The consequence to know: a
schema rebuild from empty needs ``setup()`` to have run, which is why it is
called on first use rather than at import.

**A second Postgres driver.** The app talks to Postgres over asyncpg via
SQLAlchemy; ``langgraph-checkpoint-postgres`` requires psycopg 3 and will not
accept an asyncpg connection. Both now ship. :func:`_conninfo` strips
SQLAlchemy's ``+asyncpg`` dialect suffix, which psycopg cannot parse.
