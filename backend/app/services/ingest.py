"""Turning an uploaded file into a document and its chunks.

The ordering here is the design, not an implementation detail. MinIO and
Postgres cannot share a transaction, so what a crash leaves behind depends
entirely on the sequence:

    extract text -> split chunks -> INSERT (flush, NOT committed)
                                 -> PUT to MinIO
                                 -> COMMIT

The Postgres transaction stays open across the upload. If the upload fails,
rollback discards the rows and there is no compensation code to get wrong. If
the process dies before the commit, Postgres rolls back by itself and the only
residue is an orphaned object -- invisible to the app, harmless, reapable.

Committing first and uploading second inverts that: a crash in the window
leaves a visible document whose bytes were never written, and every preview
404s. The rule, applied to deletes too: **Postgres is the source of truth;
object storage may hold orphans, never the reverse.**
