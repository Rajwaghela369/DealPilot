"""The /deals/{deal_id}/meetings contract, both directions.

Nested under the deal throughout: meetings are read from the deal detail page
and nowhere else, so there is no cross-deal collection. `meetings.deal_id` is
NOT NULL and there is no `account_id` column -- a meeting belongs to exactly
one deal, and "meetings for this account" is a join through `deals`.

Columns absent from every request model below, and why:

    analysis_status         the analyzer owns it; POST .../analysis moves it
    analyzed_at             written when analysis completes
    transcript_document_id  set by the document upload flow, not by a client
