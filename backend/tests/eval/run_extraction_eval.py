"""Score extraction on the fixture corpus, for one model or all three.

    # score recorded runs: no API calls, no key
    python tests/eval/run_extraction_eval.py --replay tests/eval/recorded

    # task 11.11's three-way comparison, on the current prompt
    python tests/eval/run_extraction_eval.py --live --model all

    # task 11.10: one prompt version against another, same model
    python tests/eval/run_extraction_eval.py --live --prompt extract_v3

``--model all`` is the challenger comparison task 1.5 (reopened as 11.11) asks
for. The Qwen model belongs **here and nowhere else**: it is Preview tier and
several times the primary's price (docs/ai/README.md section 7), so a second
opinion on the eval set is exactly the right amount of exposure to it.

The live path does not improvise. It calls ``app.ai.extract`` -- the extractor
the pipeline uses -- with an overridden model role and prompt, and reads the
transcripts' chunks out of the database rather than re-chunking them, because
every label's offsets point into those exact rows. An eval scored against a
prompt or a chunking nothing else uses measures nothing.

It needs the fixture corpus ingested (``tests/fixtures/load.py``) and postgres
up; it writes recordings into ``recorded/`` so a comparison can be re-scored
later with no key.
