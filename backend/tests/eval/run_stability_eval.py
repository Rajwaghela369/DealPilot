"""Task 11.9: how stable is risk detection on an unchanged deal?

Runs ``detect_ai.shadow_run`` N times against one deal and scores risk-key
stability plus per-risk verdict flicker. **Writes nothing** -- ``shadow_run``
proposes and scores against the deterministic rules without touching the
database, which is the whole reason it exists (task 7.4).

    # the task's sample: ten runs on the fixture deal
    python tests/eval/run_stability_eval.py --deal "SecureFlow Enterprise" -n 10

    # re-score a saved run with no API calls and no key
    python tests/eval/run_stability_eval.py --replay recorded/stability/stability-<n>.json

Why ten and not two: 7.4 had n=2 and reported Jaccard 0.67, which is one
disagreement on one key and cannot distinguish an occasional wobble from a
detector that alternates between two answers. Ten runs make the per-key
appearance rate readable, which is the number that says *which* card flickers.

The runs are sequential, not gathered. Concurrency would have them contend for
the same governor bucket and turn a stability measurement into a throttling
measurement, and a throttled extraction window already waits ~77 seconds.
