"""Task 0.3's live acceptance check: does `client.structured()` actually work?

Not in the pytest suite, because it needs a key and spends money (a fraction of
a cent). It is the cheapest possible answer to three questions that are
ambiguous when a later failure happens:

    1. is the key valid?
    2. is the model id right for this account?
    3. does Groq's json_schema structured output work here?

Run from `backend/` with AI_ENABLED=true and GROQ_API_KEY set:
